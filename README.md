Abstract:

Since the introduction of models that could reconstruct the dense 3D geometry of a face from a single image, there has been a trend in academia for models that could enhance this capability in high-resolution scenarios. However, the reconstruction event is also important for situations where images in low-resolution are the majority, such as in general surveillance.  
This project aims at the development of a 3D face reconstruction model from a single low-resolution image using advances in volumetric convolutional neural networks regression and generative models. 
The main tasks related to this application are image super-resolution, face alignment, and 3D face reconstruction.
